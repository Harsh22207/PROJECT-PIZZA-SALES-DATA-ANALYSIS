# PROJECT-PIZZA-SALES-DATA-ANALYSIS
Developed an interactive dashboard in MS Excel, utilizing MySQL queries to extract valuable insights and key performance indicators.

This project involves analyzing pizza sales data from a pizza restaurant.
The goal is to derive key performance metrics and create various visualizations to gain insights into the restaurant's performance.

These key performance metrics are derived using by importing sales to MySQL server and then running appropriate queries for the required results.
Also, made an interactive dashboard with charts and visualization of the sales data along with key performance metrics.
The specific tasks and visualizations required are as follows:

Metrics to Calculate:

1) Total Revenue: Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.

2) Average Order Value: Determine the average value of each order.

3) Total Pizzas Sold: Compute the total number of pizzas sold.

4) Total Orders: Find the total number of orders placed.

5) Average Pizzas per Order: Calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per transaction.

Charts and Visualizations:

1) Daily Trend for Total Orders: Create a bar chart to display the daily trend of orders over a specified time period.
This will help identify fluctuations or patterns in daily order volumes.

2) Hourly Trend for Total Orders: Develop a line chart to show hourly trends of total orders within a day, aiming to identify peak hours.

3) Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category: Generate a pie chart to visualize the distribution of sales across different pizza categories,
highlighting popular categories and their impact on overall sales.

4) Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size: Create a pie chart to illustrate the distribution of sales by pizza size,
identifying the most popular sizes and their influence on total sales.

5) Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category: Design a funnel chart to display the total number of pizzas sold in each category,
allowing for a comparison of sales across categories.

6) Top 5 Best Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold: Develop a bar chart showcasing the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on the total number of pizzas sold,
highlighting the most popular options.

7) Bottom 5 Worst Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold: Create a bar chart for the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on total sales,
identifying underperforming or less popular options.
